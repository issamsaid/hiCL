# Possible rooms to improvement
We are planning to improve the following features of the **hiCL** library:
* The lookup performance of the hiCL descriptors (kernels, devices, 
  objects).
* The Fortran calls to run and execute kernels.
* Coverage tests and functional tests.
* A templated version of the library hiCL++.

We are actively looking for volunteers to receive feedbacks and feature 
requests and more importantly to help us improve the library.

# Contribution guide
You should fork the ** develop **  branch and put together your modifications
into pull requests. The unit tests of all your modifications should be also 
provided and pass the build on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/issamsaid/hiCL).
