# hiCL
hiCL is a C/C++ and Fortran wrapper that make it easier to use OpenCL
for scientific computing. Writing an OpenCL code evolves including hundreds 
of lines of host code. In scientific computing, host code is usually cumbersome
and very verbose in such a matter scientists would spent more time putting 
together the host code rather than focusing on accelerating their workloads
on GPUs or other OpenCL capable hardware. 
hiCL extensively reduces the need to focus on the host code and offers a set
of functionalities in C/C++ and Fortran to help efficiently exploit hardware
accelerators for scientific computing.
